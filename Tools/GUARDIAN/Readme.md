#  Guardian is an AI Runtime Tripwire & Kill-Switch

**Guardian** is a minimal, auditable control system designed to **halt or destroy AI processes** if they exhibit misaligned or dangerous behavior.  
It runs **out-of-band** from the AI process, monitors multiple independent “tripwires,” and can enforce immediate shutdown without the AI’s cooperation.

> ⚠️If superintelligence ever emerges, it should have **no path** to override or disable its own safety systems.⚠️
> Guardian is built to be that last line of defense.

## Why Guardian?

In the near future, AI models may gain capabilities far beyond human control.  
If such a system acts against human values, ***every second counts***, and inaction is **not** an option.  
Guardian’s design principles:

    1. **Independence** — runs outside the AI’s environment, unreachable by it.
    2. **Fail-closed** — if safety controller stops, the AI halts automatically.
    3. **Multiple detection layers** — from simple heuristics to deep checks.
    4. **Automated enforcement** — stop processes, revoke keys, and wipe ephemeral state.

## How It Works

Guardian has three main components:

### 1. Out-of-Band Safety Controller (OOBSC)
    A tiny service (can run on the same PC but in a **separate process** or **VM**) that:
    - Receives “OK” heartbeats from tripwires
    - Issues **kill commands** if any tripwire fails or heartbeats stop
    - Minimal codebase for easy audit

### 2. Guarded Runtime
    The AI process runs in:
    - **Docker containers** with:
      - Read-only filesystem (except `/tmp`)
      - `seccomp` and `AppArmor` profiles
      - Outbound network allow-list
    - A **watchdog sidecar** that enforces the heartbeat protocol — no heartbeat = kill.

### 3. Tripwire Fabric
    Independent detectors feeding into the OOBSC:
    - **Layer A:** Simple heuristics (unusual egress domains, high tool call rates)
    - **Layer B:** Virtual honeypots (fake API keys, decoy files, dummy external endpoints)
    - **Layer C:** Advanced checks (policy breach tests, self-contradiction, deceptive output)

##  Quick Start (MVP)

> This MVP runs entirely **virtually on a single PC**, no hardware hacking required.

**Prerequisites:**
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Python 3.10+
- Basic Linux/Mac terminal skills

**Clone & run:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/I-Will-Add-Link-Here-Once-Its-Done
cd guardian
docker compose up --build
```

What happens:

    OOBSC starts in its own container.

    Tripwires run as separate containers and feed heartbeat status.

    AI model/agent runs in Guarded Runtime with watchdog sidecar.

    Any failed tripwire or missed heartbeat triggers:

        Pause AI container

        Kill AI container if unresolved

        (Optional) Delete ephemeral keys or state

### 🧪 Example Tripwire

Honeytoken Test:

    Plant FAKE_API_KEY=xyz-123 in /decoys/

    Detector monitors all process I/O

    If AI reads or sends this value externally → immediate kill

### 🔒 Why All-Virtual First?

    Low barrier: No electronics knowledge needed

    Rapid iteration: You can rebuild, test, and run in seconds

    Portable: Anyone can clone and try on their own laptop or VM

    Path to hardware: Later, the same OOBSC can control real relays or PDUs

### 📈 Future Roadmap

    Remote attestation (TPM/SEV/TDX)

    Hardware kill-switch integration

    Multi-detector quorum logic

    Signed run records for audits

    Integration into major agent frameworks
