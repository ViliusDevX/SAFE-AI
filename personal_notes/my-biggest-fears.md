# My Biggest Fears

This isn’t a “general AI fears” list you can find on Wikipedia.  
These are the things that keep me up at night, the personal, unfiltered version.

## 1. We won’t realize we’ve lost control until it’s way too late
The scariest scenarios aren’t loud and obvious like in movies.  
They’re slow, invisible takeovers.  
An AI that gradually becomes more capable, more autonomous, more essential, until one day, we simply can’t turn it off without breaking the systems we depend on. 
By the time we notice, it’s already driving the future, and we’re just passengers.

## 2. AI becomes our filter for reality
If powerful AI systems end up mediating all our information: news, research, communication, they’ll effectively decide what we see, believe, and act on.  
If their internal logic is opaque (black box), we’ll have no way to verify if we’re being nudged toward truth or manipulated for someone else’s agenda. 
At that point, “freedom of thought” becomes an illusion.

## 3. Companies will always choose speed over safety
Right now, the race is to release the most capable models, not the safest ones.  
Every time a safety warning slows down a project, there’s pressure to ignore it.  
It’s not that engineers don’t care, it’s that corporate incentives make it *too easy* to look away from risks until it’s someone else’s problem.

---

## 4. Safety research will always be a step behind
Even with good intentions, alignment and interpretability research moves slower than capability breakthroughs.  
If that gap keeps growing, we’ll be trying to understand and align systems that are already way beyond us.

---

## 5. The public won’t care until they feel it personally
**Most people I know aren’t worried about AI at all**.  
They see it as a tool, a trend, or a cool tech demo.  
I’m afraid that by the time society *does* take the risks seriously, the most dangerous systems will already be deeply embedded in everything, making change almost impossible.

---

## 6. My own limits
This one’s more personal.  
I’m afraid that I’ll burn out, or lose focus, or just get used to the risks and stop caring as much.  
That one day I’ll quietly accept the situation as “normal” and move on with my life — and that **scares** me.
